Blackwell blew my budget

I just caught this Nvidia deep-dive vid and, oh man, my wallet’s shaking. If you thought GPUs were only for gaming, this earnings report pretty much proves they’re the backbone of modern AI - and honestly, it’s wild.

Nvidia’s Q2 results are off the charts: $46.7B in revenue, up 56% YoY, and net income at $26.4B, a 59% jump. The data center biz is carrying the load, raking in $41.1B, with Blackwell chips alone bringing $27B. Jensen Huang didn’t hesitate to call Blackwell "the AI platform the world’s been waiting for." And I kinda believe him - OpenAI’s new gpt-oss models hit 1.5M tokens/sec on a single GB200 rack.

The vid also dives into the China saga. Nvidia can’t ship H20 chips to local clients yet, thanks to murky export rules and Beijing saying they’re "not safe." They’ve even paused H20 production until the legal stuff clears up. But despite all that, Nvidia still expects $54B in Q3 revenue and predicts $3-4T in AI infra spending by 2030.

Anyway, some practical takeaways to keep in mind:

- Budget your infra around Blackwell-class GPUs
- Factor in export regs if China’s on your client list
- Watch token-throughput benchmarks for real performance

If you’re into SRE, DevOps, or heavy data crunching, this is a must-watch. It’s the reality check on how AI hardware is shaping our future - and our spreadsheets. Go check it out!
